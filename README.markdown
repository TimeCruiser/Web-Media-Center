# Web Media Center

This is my take on a centralized media center. It is supposed to be operated
via an html5-powered web interface.

Some concepts that are supposed to be incorporated include:
* Database star schema for fast querying
* Media data to be stored as BLOBs in database to avoid file system dependencies and synchronization issues
* Nice REST-API
* Screw IE!
* Maybe HAML?
* Maybe SASS?
